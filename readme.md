# Milestone Project 2 - A Site which considers Global Inequality
https://jaypeaa.github.io/milestone2/


The project concept is focusing on the issues around Global InEquality it utilises a dashboard to visually represent the data
behind the scenes to provide a more emmersive and engaging user experience.  The site also incorporates various APIs and a
number of other feature to showcase some of the skills accrued so far on the course.


## UX

The project has been designed with the end user in mind.  The end user being members of the public who either wish to purchase tickets or book the band for a private event.
The flow of the site has been created in a traditional style with clear navigation and a large 'call to action' button (Get Tickets) placed in the header of the home screen.  This call to action button occupies prime real estate in order to drive ticket sales and contains a hover effect to drive the 'click through rate' and increase conversions.  This aspect of the site recognises its commercial nature whilst enhancing the user experience by making it easy to acquire tickets within a couple of clicks.

A user may wish to perform the following actions:

* get in touch with comments, concerns or ideas surrounding the issues of global inequality.
* understand some of the issues.
* Analyse the numbers via the interactive charts to gain a better understanding of the issues.
* contact us via the contact form.
* contact us more traditional means (post/phone/email)

The site provides all these options to the end user and is very easy to utilise and navigate.

# Features

The main features of the site are:

* Clear and Easy to Use Navigation
* Interactive Dashboard
* APIs - Google Maps, MailJS & OECD Databases
* Email subscription 
* Contact Form
* Social Media for marketing and engagement purposes
* Animation to enhance user experience, drive engagement, increase click-through and drive conversions and sales

## Future development

Future features may include development of our own API to allow other developers interested in our work to link to our own internal database.

In addition pluging this theme into a fully content managed system such as Joomla or Wordpress would make updating its content easier and more efficient to manage.
