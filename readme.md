# Milestone Project 2 - Bespoke Project to Demonstrate Use of Dashboards and Working with External APIs
https://jaypeaa.github.io/milestone2/


The project concept is from the perspective of a Technology Company ("Best Analytics") who produces dashboards and provides web design services.
The main feature of the site is the dashboard which utilises D3, Crossfilter and DC.js.  It incorporates a number of interactive charts, a data count
and a data table.  The 'Consolidated Sales Chart' includes a brush feature to easily select different time periods.


## UX

The project has been designed with the end user in mind.  The end user being buinesses predominantly who wish to utilise their MI generated by the 
business graphically on a company website. This might be to drive stakeholder engagement through the use of an interactive charting tool. 

To enhance the user experience a more modern one page theme has been designed.  It utilises the HTML scroll feature and JQuery to scroll to various
sections of the website.  As the user scroll down the page manually the nav bar highlights the current section the user is currently viewing.

A preloader has been included in the dashboard section to demonstrate to the user when data is loading.  Various elements have also been faded
out on loading the page which fade back in to view slowly when loading is complete.  JQuery was used for this purpose.  Another aspect of the site
is that when being viewed in portrait view on a mobile device an image is displayed instructing the user to rotate the device to landscape in order
to view the dashboard.

The flow of the site has been created in a more modern one page layout. Square edges and subtle use of shadow have been applied in order to make the
various sections stand out. 

A large 'call to action' button (Contact Us) has been placed in the header of the home screen.  This call to action button occupies prime real estate 
in order to drive customer enquiries and contains a hover effect to improve the 'click through rate' and increase conversions.  This aspect of the site 
recognises its commercial nature whilst enhancing the user experience by making it easy to get in touch within a couple of clicks.

A user may wish to perform the following actions:

* Utilise the example dashboard.
* Understand how the graph and data table interact with each other through experimentation.
* contact us via the contact form.
* contact us more traditional means (post/phone/email).
* reach out to us on socialmedia.

The site provides all these options to the end user and is very easy to utilise and navigate.

Wireframes for this project are available here https://github.com/JayPeaa/milestone2/blob/master/wire-frames.pdf

# Features

The main features of the site are:

* Clear and Easy to Use Navigation
* Interactive Dashboard
* APIs - Google Maps, MailJS
* Email subscription 
* Contact Form
* Social Media for marketing and engagement purposes

## Future development

The sample dataset includes customer information it would be possible to create additional charts to analyse customer behaviour and spend.  A
secure log in section and online purchase options for potential customers would also be a valuable addition (e-commerce aspect). Using AJAX and Jquery
would help to provide an even more immersive customer experience when submitting contact forms.  Another development would be the inclusion of
a database for email subscription as currently when a user submits an email via the subscription section an email is triggered as oppossed to simply
adding the user to a mailing list as part of an automated process.

# Technologies

The site is built using HTML, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap, D3.js, Crossfilter, DC.js, Javascript based technologies and Libraries. 
Usage of any libraries or CDNs is documented below:

# Testing

Testing has been conducted using google dev tools. Thorough testing in all the various mobile devices along with general responsiveness (responsive mode) has concluded
that this site works well in all modern-day browsers and mobile devices. As part of the testing process each page has been reviewed systematically to ensure all links
work as intended and the pages display correctly.  

This testing has confirmed that users will be able to utilise the site as intended on any device (in landscape or portrait mode) to achieve their goals whilst enjoying the experience and customer journey.

All user forms display correctly and as intended on various displays / devices.

Autoprefixer was used to ensure CSS is compatible in multiple browsers: https://autoprefixer.github.io/

Browser Compatibility Testing:

### Issues Encountered
Time was invested at the start of the project to ensure HTML code was working well before reusing the code for subsequent pages which saved some time.

HTML and CSS Validators were used to clear any errors. 

# Deployment

Throughout the projects regular git commits were made to ensure any working files were backed up. In excess of 20 commits have been logged on the main branch in GitHub.
The project has been successfully deployed on GitHub pages.  There is only one main branch in GitHub for this project.

AWS cloud9 has been used throughout this project as the IDE of choice.
